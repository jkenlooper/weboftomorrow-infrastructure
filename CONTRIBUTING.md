# Guide on Contributing

This is mostly for the Web of Tomorrow static website, but could in theory be
modified and used elsewhere. Improvements or other features that
could be added to this project are welcomed. Please submit a pull request and
I'll review it. Thank you!

There is also this helpful guide on
[How to contribute to an open source project](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).

## Bug Reports

Submit any bugs as an issue to the project's GitHub page. If it is a security
issue then send it directly to the maintainer.
